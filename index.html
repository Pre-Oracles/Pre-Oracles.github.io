<title>Tag World view</title>

<h1>Tag World</h1>
<p>Hello, this is just a project i am working on to practice my css html skill.
  The ultimate purpose is to tell a imagary world that i created. It was inpspired books, games, movie about medieval times.
  There really isn't a point to all of these. I am not even sure why you are here.</p>
